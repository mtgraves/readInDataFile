Method for reading in columns of data separated by white space from a text file using C++.

This is in the form of a function  set up to read columns of numbers in scientific notation, convert them to doubles,
and then store them in a vector of vectors (defined from here on as Vec[All]).  The function returns
vec[All].  Within the main function, the desired columns are stored in new vectors and vec[All] is
deleted from memory.
